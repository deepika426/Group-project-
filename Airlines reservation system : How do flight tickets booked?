today i will be reaching out to my friends who book flight tickets frequently and compare his accounts fare prices 
to that of mine ( new user). i will also see that how the pattern follows for early booking and end time booking.

Me and my groupmates sat together and planned how to work on our respective topics.
I also started asking for suggestions on how we could approach our presentation from a technological perspective.
I selected the topic “Research the History of Airline Reservation Systems,” and we planned to explore how the airline booking system evolved over time — from the early days when there was a need for pre-booking systems to how technology was gradually adopted and improved.
We also had a discussion about the concept of overbooking tickets and realized that it is primarily beneficial for airlines, as it creates higher demand and can lead to increased pricing.
Additionally, I found some useful resources to support my topic. These include:
1.Timeline: The History of Airline Reservation Systems
2.Wikipedia: Airline Reservations System
3.History of Flight Booking: CRSs, GDS Distribution, Travel Agencies, and Online Reservations
